 
Exercise (Instructions): NPM Scripts Part 1
Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise, you will learn to set up NPM scripts by modifying the package.json file. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

    Watch for changes to the styles.scss file and automatically compile it to the css file.
    Run multiple NPM scripts in parallel using parallelshell NPM module.

Moving JS to Script file

    Create a folder named js and in that folder create a file named scripts.js.
    Open index.html and from this file cut out all the JQuery script that we added to it and move the code to the scripts.js file that we created above.
    Then, update the index.html file to include the scripts.js file by adding the following line:

            1      <script src="js/scripts.js"></script>

    Add the same line to the scripts block in aboutus.html and contactus.html:

Watching for Changes and Parallelshell

    First, we install two NPM packages onchange and parallelshell as follows:

            1      npm install --save-dev onchange@3.3.0 parallelshell@3.0.2

    Then, add the following two script items to package.json if you are doing the exercise on a MacOS computer or a Linux computer:

            1    "watch:scss": "onchange 'css/*.scss' -- npm run scss",
            2    "watch:all": "parallelshell 'npm run watch:scss' 'npm run lite'"

    NOTE: If you are doing the exercise on a Windows computer, please use the following two script items instead of the above:

            1   "watch:scss": "onchange \"css/*.scss\" -- npm run scss",
            2   "watch:all": "parallelshell \"npm run watch:scss\" \"npm run lite\""

    You will also update the start script as follows:

            1   "start": "npm run watch:all",

    Then, type the following at the prompt to start watching for changes to the SCSS file, compile it to CSS, and run the server:

            1   npm start

    Now, whenever you make any changes to styles.scss file, it will automatically be compiled to the corresponding css file.
    Do a Git Commit with the message "NPM Scripts Part 1".

Conclusions

In this exercise, you learnt how to set up a watch task to watch for changes to a file and automatically run tasks upon detecting changes.
